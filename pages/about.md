# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
As a **Solutions Architect** I have been fortunate to contribute in the last 15 years to start-ups, mid-size companies, and big corporations, developing my technical expertise and learning to think strategically to maximize benefits. I bring individuals, teams, and companies together to build solutions to complex problems and to bring visions to life. I learned to articulate complex technological concepts to diverse stakeholders, building life-lasting relationships, and driving business growth. My experience as a Software Engineer equips me with a deep understanding of innovative technologies, enabling me to create and design innovative solutions that align with organisational objectives. When time permits, I like to travel, exercise, and explore recent technologies and ideas. My goal is to continue learning and to share what I learned with others while achieving goals and enjoying how others use or consume the services I helped to build.
